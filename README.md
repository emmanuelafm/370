## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given starter code for a treasure hunt game in which a human player must complete faster than a "pirate" NPC. I created the code to configure the Q-learning algorithm for our intelligent agent.
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
AI and machine learning are becoming increasingly popular topics in the tech industry, especially with companies like OpenAI showing revolutionary developments in the idea of how computers learn from us. One of our first assignments, which looked at CIFAR-10 dataset, is one of the first steps in what OpenAI has accomplished. I would love to research this topic more in the future.
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create and maintain software, as well as constantly learn about how technology is evolving. In the span of a regular person's career (about 45 years), we have gone from the first perseonal computer to over 15 generations of the iPhone, an invention that was thought of as impossible just two decades ago. With these incredibly fast changes have also come some controversies, meaning there is still much more work to be done in the ethical development of technology. 
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first understanding the problem, then taking time to analyze each detail of the code that could be contributing to the issue, and then looking back at the issue to see if they align. Taking time to look at both the big picture and smaller details is what helps one understand the source of an issue and also prevent future incidents of similar nature. 
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My biggest ethical responsibility is transparency with end users and the organization. By being completely upfront and honest about what I am working on and how user data plays into that, I can be certain that my projects will be user-friendly and follow GDPR laws.
